  abstract        = {The web has become a platform that attackers exploit to infect vulnerable hosts, or deceive victims into buying rogue software. To accomplish this, attackers either inject malicious scripts into popular web sites or manipulate content delivered by servers to exploit vulnerabilities in users' browsers. To hide malware distribution servers, attackers employ HTTP redirections, which automatically redirect users' requests through a series of intermediate web sites, before landing on the final distribution site. In this paper, we develop a methodology to identify malicious chains of HTTP redirections. We build per-user chains from passively collected traffic and extract novel statistical features from them, which capture inherent characteristics from malicious redirection cases. Then, we apply a supervised decision tree classifier to identify malicious chains. Using a large ISP dataset, with more than 15K clients, we demonstrate that our methodology is very effective in accurately identifying malicious chains, with recall and precision values over 90% and up to 98%.},

  abstract        = {Securing web applications against open redirect vulnerabilities is important for protecting users from malicious redirection and phishing attacks. Open Redirect attacks occur when a malicious actor manipulates a link on a vulnerable web-site to redirect users to a malicious destination, often disguised as legitimate. This paper proposes a Google Chrome extension named Open Redirect Analysis Tool (ORAT), a tool that analyses a website for potential open redirect attacks. ORAT enables the detection of such vulnerabilities directly within the browser. It uses a straightforward interface and it simplifies the process of scanning web applications for unsafe redirects by applying a curated set of test payloads to uncover vulnerabilities, from the obvious to the subtle ones. The tests show that ORAT can identify and present open redirect vulnerabilities. Also, a discussion is provided about the limitations encountered, such as the scope of testing payloads and browser specificity, and a roadmap for future iterations of the proposed tool is proposed. By advancing the capabilities for early detection of redirect vulnerabilities, ORAT contributes to the set of tools available to cybersecurity practitioners and web developers, aiming to foster a secure online environment.},

A comparative study of the in-use anti-phishing tools was accomplished and their limitations were acknowledged. We analyzed the URL-based features used in the past to improve their definitions as per the current scenario which is our major contribution. Also, a step wise procedure of designing an anti-phishing model is discussed to construct an efficient framework which adds to our contribution.

This phenomenon forces the users of the internet to get connected with the internet for a prolonged time and hence it increases the chances of the users to get caught in the web of phishing - an attack crafted by hackers to steal sensitive information by tempting the users with lucrative offers initially and then redirecting them to a fraudulent website(which the user may not suspect) where they can deceive the user by asking them to submit their credentials(usually users submit their credentials without knowing that these are fake offers created with a sole intention of stealing sensitive information). In spite of the alert and awareness given by the web community in this regard, more and more phishing artist succeed in their attack. Also these phishing artist develop novel attacks such as tab nabbing, website impersonation etc that attracts more and more internet user to be caught in the web of phishing. However many tools and methodologies have been developed to prevent phishing and to alert users orally and visually. But still the success rates of the phishing attack remains high and also the approaches related to phishing detection suffers high false positive and false negative ratio. In this paper various tools and methodologies used to prevent phishing has been analyzed and an efficient mechanism has been proposed to prevent phishing.},

Malware scanners are used to identify these fraudulent websites. However, the efficacy of these scanners is limited to the information they receive. Threat actors exploit this limitation by leveraging evasion techniques, such as redirecting to benign webpages or delivering different content, to conceal their malicious intent. This underscores the need for enhanced defense mechanisms against phishing attacks to safeguard individuals from falling prey to these fraudulent schemes. In this research, we investigate the prevalence of scan evasion techniques employed by phishing websites and evaluate the effectiveness of defense strategies by comparing the responses obtained from both a user and a malware scanner. Our findings reveal a notable number of phishing websites employing evasion techniques. While the majority of these websites were detected by the malware scanner, there were instances where evasion was successful.},

Nowadays many technical solutions on phishing detection were developed, however these approaches were either unsuccessful or unable to identify phishing pages and detect malicious codes efficiently. One of the downside is due to poor detection accuracy and low adaptability to new phishing connections. Another reason behind the unsuccessful anti-phishing solutions is an arbitrary selected URL-based classification features which may produce false results to the detection. Therefore, in this work, an intelligent phishing detection and prevention model is designed. The proposed model employs a self-destruct detection algorithm in which, machine learning, especially supervised learning algorithm was used. All employed rules in algorithm will focus on URL-based web characteristic, which attackers rely upon to redirect the victims to the simulated sites. A dataset from various sources such as Phish Tank and UCI Machine Learning repository were used and the testing was conducted in a controlled lab environment. As a result, a chrome extension phishing detection were developed based on the proposed model to help in preventing phishing attacks with an appropriate countermeasure and keep users aware of phishing while visiting illegitimate websites. It is believed that this smart phishing detection and prevention model able to prevent fraud and spam websites and lessen the cyber-crime and cyber-crisis that arise from year to year.},

The primary objective of cyberattacks is to obtain sensitive data, including names, passwords, and other details. Cyberattacks are in practice in many ways, and phishing is one of the types. It involves tricking people into divulging sensitive data like location, passwords or credit card details by disguising it as a respected organization or a helpful resource. According to a report from SlashNext, phishing attacks rose by 61% in 2022. Phishing attacks can be employed in various ways and frequently start with an email or developing a hostile website, or redirecting the user to a spam on malicious site. This research paper aims to identify abnormalities in the phishing URLs from visualisation of the attributes and also classify the URLs using binary classification. The binary classification involves two classes: phishing URLsand legitimate URLs. In order to achieve this task, we first investigated different features of the URL using data visualisation and performed data transformation and feature selection based on correlation analysis and F-test to understand the contribution of the features. The visualisations attempted in this research are useful for finding the visible difference in the abnormal activity done by the attackers. Machine and Ensemble learning methods were applied once feature selection for classification of the URLs were initiated. This was followed by hyper-parameter tuning on the best performing model. The output of our experiments shows that LightGBM is giving better accuracy of 98.4%.},

  abstract        = {Each month, more attacks are launched with the aim of making web users believe that they are communicating with a trusted entity which compels them to share their personal, financial information. Acquired sensitive information is then used for personal benefits, like, gain access to money of the individuals from whom the information was taken. Phishing costs Internet users billions of dollars every year. A recent report highlighted phishing loss of around $448 million to organizations in April 2014. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) created an anti-phishing landing page supported by Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) with the aim to train users on how to prevent themselves from phishing attacks. It is used by financial institutions, phish site take down vendors, government organizations, and online merchants. When a potential victim clicks on a phishing link that has been taken down, he / she is redirected to the landing page. In this paper, we present the comparative analysis on two datasets that we obtained from APWG's landing page log files; one, from September 7, 2008 - November 11, 2009, and other from January 1, 2014 - April 30, 2014. We found that the landing page has been successful in training users against phishing. Forty six percent users clicked lesser number of phishing URLs from January 2014 to April 2014 which shows that training from the landing page helped users not to fall for phishing attacks. Our analysis shows that phishers have started to modify their techniques by creating more legitimate looking URLs and buying large number of domains to increase their activity. We observed that phishers are exploiting Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) accredited registrars to launch their attacks even after strict surveillance. We saw that phishers are trying to exploit free subdomain registration services to carry out attacks. In this paper, we also compared the phishing e-mails used by phishers to lure victims in 2008 and 2014. We found that the phishing e-mails have changed considerably over time. Phishers have adopted new techniques like sending promotional e-mails and emotionally targeting users in clicking phishing URLs.},

  abstract        = {Nowadays DNS spoofing has become one of the terrible attacks which is triggered by exploiting IP address conflict detection vulnerability on the DHCP server side. DHCP server running on latest operating systems can detect IP address conflict which makes proposed attack ineffective. On the other hand, DNS spoofing attack using server side DNS cache poisoning is very difficult and unfeasible task as the public DNS servers are very secured and deployed behind several security appliances. Again, DNS spoofing attack is initiated by poisoning the client’s DNS cache, which is uncertain as it requires a malware to be installed in target user’s computer. Therefore, the objective of this study is to introduce an innovative approach for ethically launching a DNS spoofing attack within a Local Area Network (LAN) for illustrating the vulnerabilities and security flaws of the DNS protocol. To achieve this objective, attacker introduces a rogue DHCP server in the LAN and forcefully redirects user’s traffic to a malicious or rogue default gateway. Secondly, a python (scapy) based DNS spoofing engine is deployed in the rogue DHCP server that tampers the DNS responses replied by the DNS server. The scapy alters the IP address of legitimate website with an IP address of malicious or phishing website which is managed by the attacker and looks like legitimate website. As a result, compromised user is redirected to that identical looking phishing website and becomes victim of phishing attack. Finally, the effectiveness and validation of the proposed attack were demonstrated using the Kali Linux and multi-vendor network emulation software (EVE-NG).},
