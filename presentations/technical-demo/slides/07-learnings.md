## Key Learnings

**1. Same Domain, Different Paradigms**
- Forward-chaining (ENGCIA): Data-driven, reactive pattern matching
- Backward-chaining (PPROGIA): Goal-driven, logical inference
- Both effective for phishing detection with different strengths

**2. Architecture Reflects Course Goals**
- Knowledge Engineering: Focus on rules engine, simpler deployment
- AI Paradigms: Explore multiple approaches, full-stack integration

**3. Real-World Validation is Critical**
- OpenPhish dataset essential for testing
- Production-ready systems require extensive validation
- Performance testing reveals architectural bottlenecks
